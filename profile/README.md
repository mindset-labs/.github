# Mindset Labs DAO

## Introduction

Mindset Labs DAO is an online social initiative to create and manage a community revolving around tech education, specifically blockchain development, and open-source web3 products built with a profit sharing model.

The goal is to start by releasing a course for smart-contracts development along with a set of smart contracts to manage the most basic elements of a DAO. This is to be built with CosmWasm (rust-based smart contracts) and released to kick-start the community.

Other closely related initiatives such as the release of an NFT collection will accompany the DAO as some of the first community-led projects with many more to come in the future.

Success is to be measured by how many projects the community has released and earns income from. Earned income from projects is to be distributed among contributors, community members (NFT holders) and the DAO treasury (staked).

In simple words, we must think of this as a social experiment running as a DAO. If it works, we can say that we were a part of a new social structure that may evolve into something bigger in the future.

We are workings towards the ultimate goal of being an education & product development network-state operating on-chain.
